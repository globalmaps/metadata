gmcl10,2008-02-20,,"The Global Map of Chile (Sector in South American Continent and Pacific Ocean) was developed mostly on the basis of an extract from the digital database of Chilean territory maintained by the Military Geographic Institute of Chile. The extract taken from the 1:250,000 series of topographic maps (Universal Transversal Mercator) consisted of those feature types corresponding to Global Map specifications for the Vector layers. This base was converted to 1:1,000,000 and edited to bring it closer to GM specifications, working on both the graphic elements and the tables of alphanumeric data associated. The Antarctic sector of the Global Map of Chile was developed on the basis of an extract from existing map of the whole Antarctic Continent (made by IGM, published in 1999 at 1:10,000,000 scale, Polar Stereographic). This base was converted to 1:1,000,000 and edited to bring it closer to GM specifications, working on both the graphic elements and the tables of alphanumeric data associated. "
